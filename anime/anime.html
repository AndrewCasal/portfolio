            <p>This page was made to demonstrate the message generator code that was created as part of my training as a full-stack engineer. The project goal was to build a code that when it was run would create a message with 3 items that would be randomly generated. We had full creative range to choose the topic and message of our choosing. I decided create a message that generator your ultimate anime warrior that included an anime character, a power up, and an important item from each of the different storylines. The assignment was to only create the code, however it was my desire to use this code and build a full webpage in order to show a full range of front-end skills.</p>
